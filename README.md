# Heads or Tails Game

A simple console-based game built in Java where the user plays Heads or Tails against the computer for 5 rounds. Each round, the player selects either "Heads" or "Tails", and the computer randomly makes its choice. The player with the most correct guesses at the end wins.

Features:
- 5 rounds of gameplay
- Random choice generation for the computer
- Input validation (only allows "Heads" or "Tails")
- Live score tracking per round
- Final winner display
- Clean console-based interaction

How it works:
- You will be prompted to choose either Heads or Tails.
- The computer randomly picks its own choice.
- If your guess matches the computer's, you get a point.
- After 5 valid rounds, the game declares the winner based on points.

Example:
What do you want to choose? (Heads/Tails)
> heads

You: heads || Computer: tails
Player: 0 || Computer: 1

...

Your points: 3 || Computer: 2
You win!
